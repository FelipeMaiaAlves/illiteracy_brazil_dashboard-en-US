📊 Illiteracy Analysis in Brazil (2016–2024)
🔎 Description
This project aims to perform an exploratory and visual analysis of illiteracy in Brazil, based on public data from IBGE (via Gov.br). Using data processed with Python and visualized in Power BI, we aim to understand the evolution of illiteracy by age group and race/color, and identify potential educational inequalities over the years.

🧰 Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data cleaning and preprocessing

Power BI: Interactive dashboard development

Data Source: Open data from Gov.br / IBGE (2016–2024)

📌 Key Insights
📉 Approximately 14.6% reduction in total illiterates between 2016 and 2024.

🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Black and brown individuals remain the most affected group, accounting for about 73% of the total in 2024.

👵 Seniors (60 years or older) show the highest illiteracy rates, indicating the impact of historical exclusion.

⚖️ Despite overall decline, racial disparities persist throughout the historical series.
