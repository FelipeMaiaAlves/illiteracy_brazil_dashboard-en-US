📊 Illiteracy Analysis in Brazil (2016–2024)
🔎 Description
This project aims to perform an exploratory and visual analysis of illiteracy in Brazil, based on public data from IBGE (via Gov.br). Using data processed with Python and visualized in Power BI, we seek to understand the evolution of illiteracy by age group and race/color, and identify possible educational inequalities over the years.

🧰 Tools Used
