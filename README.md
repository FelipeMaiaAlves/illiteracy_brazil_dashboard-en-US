# Illiteracy in Brazil - Data Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes public data on illiteracy rates in Brazil from 2016 to 2024. Using official datasets, we explore trends by race/color and age groups, highlighting social inequalities.

The analysis is performed in Python, and an interactive dashboard is created using Power BI to visualize insights such as:
- Temporal evolution of illiteracy rates by race/color
- Comparison of illiteracy across age groups
- Reduction percentage of illiteracy over time

## Data Sources
Data was gathered from official public sources like IBGE and government open data portals.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (data cleaning and analysis)
- Power BI (dashboard creation and visualization)

## Dashboard Features
- Line charts showing the evolution of illiteracy by race/color from 2016 to 2024
- Stacked bar charts comparing annual illiteracy across races
- Bar charts illustrating illiteracy differences by age groups and race/color
- KPI cards presenting total illiteracy, percentage reduction, and breakdown by race/color in the most recent year

## Insights and Hypotheses
- Illiteracy rates have decreased overall but disparities by race/color persist
- Older age groups show higher illiteracy prevalence, indicating historical inequalities
- The reduction percentage varies across racial groups, suggesting different impacts of educational policies

## How to Use
- Open the Power BI dashboard file to explore the interactive visuals
- Filter by age groups or race/color to customize your analysis
- Review the KPIs for quick overview metrics
